<h1>PEAK (2025)</h1>
<h2><strong>Game Info</strong> &nbsp;</h2>
<p><span class="text-tiny">(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)</span></p>
<p><i><strong>PEAK</strong></i> is a cooperative climbing video game developed and published by Aggro Crab and Landfall for Windows (Steam) on 16 June 2025. The objective of the game is to climb a pre-generated mountain with up to four players.</p>
<p>The game supports up to four players that can communicate via proximity chat with the objective being to climb a mountain following a crash landing on an unknown island. The map changes every 24 hours. Players must also maintain their own stamina bar, which is depleted as the player climbs the mountain by hunger, injury, and various other ailments. Players can revive their teammates through several methods, including the use of altars found at campsites, which serve as rest areas between levels. There are four of these levels, each a different biome with unique obstacles. Players can carry up to three items, and can use a backpack to carry up to four more. Upon completing the default difficulty, players are awarded an in-game cosmetic sash, and unlock harder difficulties.</p>
