# PEAK (2025)

## **Game Info**  

(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

***PEAK*** is a cooperative climbing video game developed and published by Aggro Crab and Landfall for Windows (Steam) on 16 June 2025. The objective of the game is to climb a pre-generated mountain with up to four players.

The game supports up to four players that can communicate via proximity chat with the objective being to climb a mountain following a crash landing on an unknown island. The map changes every 24 hours. Players must also maintain their own stamina bar, which is depleted as the player climbs the mountain by hunger, injury, and various other ailments. Players can revive their teammates through several methods, including the use of altars found at campsites, which serve as rest areas between levels. There are four of these levels, each a different biome with unique obstacles. Players can carry up to three items, and can use a backpack to carry up to four more. Upon completing the default difficulty, players are awarded an in-game cosmetic sash, and unlock harder difficulties.

## Overlay Guide (Spoiler-Free)

The game's UI is easily avoidable thanks to it's very basic layout.

There is a Stamina Bar in the bottom left of the screen, and a inventory in the bottom right of the screen, along with button prompts when holding an item.

When looking at an interactable object, there will be a interaction prompt in the middle of the screen that states the interaction name and what button to press. And lastly, there is a notification box at the top left of the screen that will indicate when players have left the game, joined the game, etc.

As long as you avoid the **bottom left and right**, and the **top-left**, you can place your streaming/recording overlays anywhere on screen without it interfering with gameplay elements.

Many streamers who have already streamed this game prior to this article have often placed their webcam in the middle-left/middle-right, with their chat below their webcam.

For example. this is a content creator called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElasticDroid">ElasticDroid</a>, where in this video (here), his camera is at the top right, with his Twitch chat below, and his Alert Box is in the top-centre of the screen (not visible in screenshot.)
